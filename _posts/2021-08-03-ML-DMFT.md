This work is a collaborative work, thus my contribution to this research is
- Conducting DMFT-NRG and obtain data from it.
- Train neural network model with DMFT-NRG hybridization function, calculate accuracy
- Transformation of weight matrix to ensure that the input layer receives the Matsubara frequency domain data.
- Test our neural network model with the hybridization function on the Matsubara frequency domain. 
- Analyze the structure of neural network.

This is the remaining research that my contribution is smaller.
- ...and find the quantity $S_2$, which is similar to order parameter.
- Train the linear perceptron model with $S_2$, confirm that it is the order parameter.


## Introduction of DMFT
Dynamic mean-field theory is the method to describe the properties of the strongly correlated materials.
DMFT maps many-body lattice problem into many-body local problem which is the impurity problem.
Especially using the Anderson impurity model, it is now solvable with the self-consistency equation.
Various solvers are such as NRG(numerical renormalization group), ED(exact diagonalization), or QMC(quantum Monte-Carlo).
