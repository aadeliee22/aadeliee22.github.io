## Description
This website is to list what I have done. I guess that nobody is looking this website, because this website is boring. 

But to whom will come and read these pages: Thank you for your delightful interest! 
And also sorry for my boring website and slight knowledge that will not quite interest you.

### Detail
The categories are classified by time. I have counted each year's start as March, since it is the beginning of the new semester.
Therefore, 
- 2000-1 : spring semester of year 2000, which is between March 1 ~ June 31 2000.
- 2000-s : summer semester of year 2000, which is between July 1 ~ August 31 2000.
- 2000-2 : fall semester of year 2000, which is between September 1 ~ December 31 2000.
