## Description
This website is to list what I have done. And actually, there is no such plan for this website. This is just my hobby.
I guess that nobody is looking this website, because this website is boring. 

### Detail
The categories are classified by time. I have counted each year's start as March.
- 2000-1 : spring semester, March 1 ~ June 31 2000.
- 2000-1.5 : summer semester, July 1 ~ August 31 2000.
- 2000-2 : fall semester, September 1 ~ December 31 2000.
- 2000-2.5 : winter semester, January 1 ~ February 28 2001.

For other miscellaneous things, it is classified as 'trivial'. (According to the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman (Feynman 1997), mathematicians designate any theorem as "trivial" once a proof has been obtained--no matter how difficult the theorem was to prove in the first place. There are therefore exactly two types of true mathematical propositions: trivial ones, and those which have not yet been proven. [Trivial](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Trivial.html).)
