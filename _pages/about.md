## Introduction
This website is to list what I have done. Here is my [CV](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ngdpxtzhtmwz), for more detailed informations.

### Research interest
- Condensed matter theory (CMT)
   * Strongly correlated systems
   * Topological phase, insulator
- Computational Many-body physics
- Implementation of Machine learning; Neural networks


## Timeline

### 2021
- 21-summer
   * Machine-learning assisted prediction of metal-insulator transition in DMFT. Finding order parameter that can be employed both to the real frequency domain and the Matsubara frequency domain. Currently writing a paper. ([github](https://github.com/aadeliee22/Hubbard_NN), [summary](https://aadeliee22.github.io/physics%20(research)/ML-DMFT/))
