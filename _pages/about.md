## Description
This website is to list what I have done. And actually, there is no such plan for this website. This is just my hobby.

I guess that nobody is looking this website, because this website is boring. 
But to whom will come and read these pages: Thank you for your delightful interest! 
And also sorry for my boring website and slight knowledge that will not quite interest you.

### Detail
The categories are classified by time. I have counted each year's start as March, since it is the beginning of the new semester.
Therefore, 
- 2000-1 : spring semester of year 2000, which is between March 1 ~ June 31 2000.
- 2000-s : summer semester of year 2000, which is between July 1 ~ August 31 2000.

- 2000-w : winter semester of year 2000, which is between January 1 ~ February 28 2001.
