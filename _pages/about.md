## Research Experience
### 2021
- 21-fall
   * Interpretation on minimal neural network to learn the metal-insulator transition in the dynamical mean-field theory. Analyzing the network connectivity to find the system measure that can be employed to broader range beyond our specific setup, based on the few bath orbitals from DMFT-ED. Currently working on publication. ([github](https://github.com/aadeliee22/Hubbard_NN), [summary](https://aadeliee22.github.io/physics%20(research)/INNinDMFT/))

- 21-summer
   * Machine learning prediction of metal-insulator transition in DMFT Hubbard model ([github](https://github.com/aadeliee22/Hubbard_NN), [summary](https://aadeliee22.github.io/physics%20(research)/ML-DMFT/))
      
- 21-spring
   * <ins>*Undergraduate thesis 1*</ins>: Calculating the hybridization function on DMFT-NRG, trying to improve the accuracy of the metal-insulator transition points.
