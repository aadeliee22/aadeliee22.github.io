## To do list

### DMFT
* ~~obtaining data of metal -- insulator and plot transition + another temperature for $\beta$ = 1000~~
* ~~start to make NN~~

### other things
* dental clinic 2/23

### routine
- study toefl for T(R/L) T(S/W) SS(V)
- exercise MWS

## For my research
> T = 0.01, transition: 2.20, 2.37  
> T = 0.001, transition: 2.20, 2.57
